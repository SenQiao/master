# Import libraries here!


# First Task

# Please return the key that related to the largest value in the given dictionary
# Example: if the dictionary is {'first': 2, 'second': 908723498234, 'third': -5}
# The function should have output 'second'


def get_biggest_key(dictionary_obj):
    # Code goes here!
    biggest_key = 0

    return biggest_key


# Second Task

# Please write a function that creates and plots a random generated gaussian distribution
# in as few lines as possible. Importing libraries don't count towards the number of lines
# Mean and standard deviation can be random, as long as the resulting plot doesn't skew


def plot_random_gauss(num_values=1000):
    # Code goes here!
